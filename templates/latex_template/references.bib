  abstract     = {Disease classification, or nosology, was historically driven
                  by careful examination of clinical features of patients. As
                  technologies to measure and understand human phenotypes
                  advanced, so too did classifications of disease, and the
                  advent of genetic data has led to a surge in genetic subtyping
                  in the past decades. Although the fundamental process of
                  refining disease definitions and subtypes is shared across
                  diverse fields, each field is driven by its own goals and
                  technological expertise, leading to inconsistent and
                  conflicting definitions of disease subtypes. Here, we review
                  several classical and recent subtypes and subtyping approaches
                  and provide concrete definitions to delineate subtypes. In
                  particular, we focus on subtypes with distinct causal disease
                  biology, which are of primary interest to scientists, and
                  subtypes with pragmatic medical benefits, which are of primary
                  interest to physicians. We propose genetic heterogeneity as a
                  gold standard for establishing biologically distinct subtypes
                  of complex polygenic disease. We focus especially on methods
                  to find and validate genetic subtypes, emphasizing common
                  pitfalls and how to avoid them.},
